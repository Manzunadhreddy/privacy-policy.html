Privacy Policy

Effective Date: 29 November 2025
App Name: NotePad

NotePad is a private, offline note-taking application made for Android devices and distributed via platforms including the Android app marketplace operated by Google Play Store.

1. Data Storage & Privacy

All notes, text, drawings, doodles, pinned notes, reminders, and locked notes are stored locally on the user’s device.

We do not collect, upload, transmit, track, or share any personal data to cloud servers or third-party services in the current version.

Passwords used to lock notes are saved only on the device and never leave the phone.

2. Permissions Used

The app may request minimal device permissions solely to enable local features:

Permission	Purpose
Notification Access	For sending reminder alerts
Alarm/Reminder Scheduling	To run reminders if the app is closed or not active
Local File Storage*	To save media (optional) and notes locally

*Storage is implicit/local and does not send data externally.

3. Security Measures

Notes locked by the user are protected using device-based security/encryption.

Lock credentials, reminder events, and note content are handled internally on the phone.

4. No Third-Party SDKs

The app does not contain Ads, Analytics, or Tracking SDKs in the current release.

No third parties have access to your notes or lock data.

5. Content & Children Safety

All content inside the app is user-generated only, created by the device owner or user.

The app is suitable for general audiences (Age 3+) and contains no preloaded external media or feeds.

6. Future Changes

If future updates introduce:

Cloud sync (e.g., Firebase)

Ads (e.g., AdMob)
You’ll be informed via in-app notice and this policy will be updated to reflect new data handling.
